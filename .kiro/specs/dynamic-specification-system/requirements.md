# Dynamic Specification System Requirements

## Introduction

The inventory system needs to handle a wide variety of electrical items, tools, and equipment, each with unique specifications. Currently, adding new specification fields requires manual updates across multiple files. We need a centralized, dynamic specification system that automatically adapts to new fields and item types without code changes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Centralized Specification Configuration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to define specification fields in one central location, so that adding new fields automatically updates the entire system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add a new specification field to the central configuration THEN it SHALL automatically appear in all relevant forms
2. WHEN I modify a field configuration THEN all components using that field SHALL reflect the changes immediately
3. WHEN I define field validation rules THEN they SHALL be applied consistently across all forms and API endpoints
4. IF I set a field as required for specific categories THEN it SHALL be enforced in forms and validation
5. WHEN I define field display order THEN fields SHALL appear in that order across all interfaces

### Requirement 2: Dynamic Form Generation

**User Story:** As a user adding inventory items, I want the form to automatically show relevant specification fields based on the selected category, so that I only see fields that apply to my item type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a category THEN the form SHALL dynamically load only relevant specification fields
2. WHEN I change categories THEN the form SHALL update to show different specification fields
3. WHEN a field has conditional logic THEN it SHALL appear/disappear based on other field values
4. WHEN I fill out a field THEN validation SHALL occur in real-time using centralized rules
5. WHEN I submit the form THEN all dynamic fields SHALL be validated and saved properly

### Requirement 3: Automatic UI Propagation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want new specification fields to automatically appear in all relevant UI components, so that I don't need to manually update multiple files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new field is added THEN it SHALL appear in product listing tables
2. WHEN a new field is added THEN it SHALL be available in search and filter options
3. WHEN a new field is added THEN it SHALL display in product detail views
4. WHEN a new field is added THEN it SHALL be included in bill generation and item selection
5. WHEN a new field is added THEN it SHALL work in bulk import/export functionality

### Requirement 4: Field Type Support

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to support various field types (text, number, select, multiselect, boolean), so that I can capture different kinds of specification data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I define a text field THEN it SHALL render as a text input with appropriate validation
2. WHEN I define a number field THEN it SHALL render as a number input with min/max validation
3. WHEN I define a select field THEN it SHALL render as a dropdown with predefined options
4. WHEN I define a multiselect field THEN it SHALL allow multiple value selection
5. WHEN I define a boolean field THEN it SHALL render as a checkbox or toggle
6. WHEN I define field-specific validation THEN it SHALL be applied automatically

### Requirement 5: Category-Based Field Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to assign specification fields to specific categories, so that users only see relevant fields for their item type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I assign fields to categories THEN they SHALL only appear for items in those categories
2. WHEN I mark fields as required for specific categories THEN validation SHALL enforce this
3. WHEN I create category hierarchies THEN child categories SHALL inherit parent category fields
4. WHEN I define category-specific field options THEN they SHALL be filtered appropriately
5. WHEN I update category field mappings THEN changes SHALL take effect immediately

### Requirement 6: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want existing inventory data to remain intact when adding new fields, so that no data is lost during system updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new fields are added THEN existing products SHALL continue to display correctly
2. WHEN field configurations change THEN existing data SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN fields are removed THEN existing data SHALL be archived but not deleted
4. WHEN field types change THEN data migration SHALL occur automatically where possible
5. WHEN validation rules change THEN existing data SHALL be grandfathered appropriately

### Requirement 7: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dynamic specification system to load quickly, so that adding inventory items remains fast and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading forms THEN specification fields SHALL load within 500ms
2. WHEN switching categories THEN field updates SHALL occur within 200ms
3. WHEN validating fields THEN validation SHALL complete within 100ms per field
4. WHEN the system has 1000+ specification fields THEN performance SHALL remain acceptable
5. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN field loading SHALL not degrade performance

### Requirement 8: Admin Interface for Field Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a user-friendly interface to manage specification fields, so that I can add and modify fields without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the admin interface THEN I SHALL see all existing specification fields
2. WHEN I create a new field THEN I SHALL be guided through all configuration options
3. WHEN I modify a field THEN I SHALL see a preview of how it will appear
4. WHEN I delete a field THEN I SHALL be warned about data implications
5. WHEN I save changes THEN they SHALL take effect immediately across the system

### Requirement 9: Import/Export Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want to import/export inventory data with dynamic specification fields, so that I can bulk manage inventory regardless of field changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I export inventory data THEN all dynamic specification fields SHALL be included
2. WHEN I import inventory data THEN dynamic fields SHALL be mapped automatically
3. WHEN importing data with new fields THEN those fields SHALL be created if configured to do so
4. WHEN field mappings are ambiguous THEN I SHALL be prompted to resolve conflicts
5. WHEN import validation fails THEN I SHALL receive clear error messages with field context

### Requirement 10: API Consistency

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want dynamic specification fields to be available through consistent API endpoints, so that external integrations work seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I query products via API THEN all dynamic specification fields SHALL be included
2. WHEN I create products via API THEN dynamic field validation SHALL be enforced
3. WHEN I request field schemas via API THEN current field configurations SHALL be returned
4. WHEN fields change THEN API documentation SHALL update automatically
5. WHEN API validation fails THEN error messages SHALL reference specific dynamic fields

## Success Criteria

- System administrators can add new specification fields in under 5 minutes
- New fields automatically appear across all system interfaces within 1 minute
- Form performance remains under 500ms load time with 100+ dynamic fields
- Zero data loss during field configuration changes
- 95% reduction in developer time needed to add new specification types
- Support for at least 20 different field types and 50+ categories
- Ability to handle 10,000+ unique specification fields without performance degradation

## Out of Scope

- Real-time collaborative editing of field configurations
- Version control for field configuration changes
- Advanced field relationships and calculations (Phase 2)
- Custom field rendering components (Phase 2)
- Multi-language field labels (Phase 2)
