## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Connection Management

```typescript
// Automatic connection with error handling
const { isConnected, connect, disconnect, refreshData } = useRealtimeSync({
  enableNotifications: true,
  enableAutoRefresh: true,
  documentTypes: ["bill", "product", "user", "stockTransaction"],
});
```

### Document Listening

```typescript
// Listen to specific document changes
useDocumentListener("bill", undefined, (update) => {
  const { transition, result } = update;
  // Handle appear/update/disappear transitions
});
```

### Provider Integration

```typescript
// Wrap pages with real-time provider
<RealtimeProvider enableNotifications={true} showConnectionStatus={true}>
  {/* Your page content */}
</RealtimeProvider>
```

## 🛡️ Production Considerations

### ✅ Error Handling

- Automatic reconnection on connection loss
- Graceful degradation when offline
- Error notifications with retry options
- Proper cleanup of subscriptions

### ✅ Performance

- Selective document listening (only relevant types)
- Debounced updates to prevent excessive re-renders
- Efficient query patterns
- Memory leak prevention

### ✅ Security

- Proper Sanity token management
- User-specific data filtering
- Secure API operations
- Input validation

### ✅ User Experience

- Visual connection status indicators
- Smooth animations for data changes
- Toast notifications for important events
- Loading states and error feedback

## 🧪 Testing Ready

### Demo Page Features (`/admin/realtime-demo`)

- **Test Data Creation**: Create products, bills, and transactions
- **Multi-Tab Views**: Switch between different data types
- **Cross-Window Testing**: Open multiple windows to test sync
- **Notification Testing**: Verify toast notifications work
- **Connection Testing**: Test connection loss and recovery

### Test Scenarios

1. ✅ Create test products → Watch inventory updates
2. ✅ Create test bills → See customer panel updates
3. ✅ Generate stock transactions → Monitor history
4. ✅ Test connection loss → Verify reconnection
5. ✅ Cross-window sync → Confirm data consistency

## 📊 Performance Metrics
