NOTES:
======

1. Dynamic keys are loaded from Sanity CMS based on category selection
2. Required fields are marked with * in the UI
3. All specification values are stored as strings or numbers
4. Validation is applied based on field type and category
5. Some fields have conditional logic (appear only for specific categories)
6. The system supports both predefined options and free-text input
7. All keys are case-sensitive
8. Use "watts" (not "wattage") for power specifications

ADDING NEW SPECIFICATION KEYS:
=============================

To add new specification keys:
1. Add the key to Sanity CMS specification options
2. Configure category field mappings
3. Add validation rules if needed
4. Update this documentation
