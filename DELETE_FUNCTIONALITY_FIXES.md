# Delete Functionality Fixes

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Circular Dependency Error**
**Problem**: `Cannot access 'refreshAlerts' before initialization`

**Root Cause**: The `deleteProduct` function was trying to use `refreshAlerts` and `refreshInventoryValue` in its dependency array, but these functions were defined after it in the code.

**Solution**: 
- Reordered the functions in `src/hooks/use-enhanced-inventory.ts`
- Moved `refreshAlerts` and `refreshInventoryValue` before `deleteProduct`
- Removed duplicate function definitions

### 2. **GROQ Query Parameter Mismatch**
**Problem**: GROQ queries were using incorrect parameter names

**Root Cause**: Queries used `$productId` but parameters were passed as `{ productId: id }`

**Solution**: 
- Changed query parameters to use `$id` 
- Updated parameter objects to `{ id }`
- Ensured consistency across all queries

### 3. **Missing Interface Property**
**Problem**: `isDeletingProduct` was not included in the hook interface

**Solution**: 
- Added `isDeletingProduct: boolean` to `UseEnhancedInventoryReturn` interface
- Ensured it's included in the return statement

## 🔧 Files Modified

### 1. `src/hooks/use-enhanced-inventory.ts`
- ✅ Reordered function definitions to fix circular dependency
- ✅ Removed duplicate `refreshAlerts` and `refreshInventoryValue` functions
- ✅ Added `isDeletingProduct` to interface
- ✅ Fixed dependency arrays in useCallback hooks

### 2. `src/lib/inventory-api-enhanced.ts`
- ✅ Fixed GROQ query parameter names
- ✅ Updated parameter objects to match query variables
- ✅ Ensured consistent parameter naming

### 3. `src/components/inventory/test-delete.tsx` (New)
- ✅ Created test component to verify hook functionality
- ✅ Provides debugging information for hook state

## 🧪 Testing

### Hook Initialization Test
```typescript
const { 
  deleteProduct, 
  isDeletingProduct, 
  deleteError,
  lowStockAlerts,
  inventoryValue 
} = useEnhancedInventory();

// Should not throw "Cannot access before initialization" error
```

### Delete Function Test
```typescript
const success = await deleteProduct(
  productId,
  isConsolidated,
  consolidatedIds
);
// Should execute without circular dependency errors
```

## 🔄 Function Order (Fixed)

### Before (Broken):
```typescript
// deleteProduct defined first
const deleteProduct = useCallback(..., [refreshAlerts, refreshInventoryValue]);

// refreshAlerts defined later (causing error)
const refreshAlerts = useCallback(...);
const refreshInventoryValue = useCallback(...);
```

### After (Fixed):
```typescript
// Helper functions defined first
const refreshAlerts = useCallback(...);
const refreshInventoryValue = useCallback(...);

// deleteProduct defined after dependencies
const deleteProduct = useCallback(..., [refreshAlerts, refreshInventoryValue]);
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Hook Initialization:
- ✅ No circular dependency errors
- ✅ All functions available immediately
- ✅ Loading states properly initialized
- ✅ Error states properly initialized

### Delete Functionality:
- ✅ Confirmation dialog shows correctly
- ✅ Delete operation executes without errors
- ✅ Data refreshes after successful deletion
- ✅ Error handling works properly
- ✅ Loading states update correctly

### Consolidated Items:
- ✅ Detects consolidated status correctly
- ✅ Shows appropriate confirmation dialog
- ✅ Deletes all related entries
- ✅ Updates UI consistently

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the fixes** by running the application
2. **Verify delete functionality** works for both individual and consolidated items
3. **Check error handling** by attempting to delete items with constraints
4. **Remove test component** once functionality is confirmed working

## 📝 Code Quality Improvements

### Dependency Management:
- Functions are now ordered logically
- Dependencies are clearly defined
- No circular references

### Error Handling:
- Proper error states for all operations
- Clear error messages for users
- Graceful degradation on failures

### Type Safety:
- All interfaces properly defined
- Return types explicitly specified
- Parameter types validated

---

## ✅ Status: Fixed

The delete functionality should now work correctly without the circular dependency error. The hook will initialize properly and all delete operations should execute as expected.
