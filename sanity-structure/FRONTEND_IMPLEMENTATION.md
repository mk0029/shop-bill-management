- Include additional charges (home visit, repair, transportation, labor)
- Upload service images if applicable

### Step 4: Payment Information

- Calculate subtotal, tax, and final amount
- Apply overall discount if needed
- Record payment details or mark as pending

### Step 5: Review and Finalize

- Review complete bill information
- Set status and priority
- Add notes for customer and internal use
- Save bill and optionally print or send to customer

## Inventory Management Interface

The inventory management interface provides tools for tracking and managing product stock:

## User Interface Components

The frontend utilizes several reusable components to maintain consistency:

### Navigation Components

## Data Flow

The frontend communicates with the Sanity backend through a structured data flow:

### Data Fetching

- **Lazy Loading**: Loads additional data as needed for performance
- **Real-time Updates**: Subscribes to changes for critical data

### Data Manipulation

- **Create Operations**: Submits new documents to Sanity
- **Update Operations**: Modifies existing documents
- **Delete Operations**: Removes documents with appropriate safeguards
