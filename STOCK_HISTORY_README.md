## Files Created/Modified

### Core API Service

- `src/lib/stock-history-api.ts` - Main API service for fetching stock data
- `src/hooks/use-stock-history.ts` - React hook for managing stock history state

### Demo & Testing

- `src/lib/demo-stock-data.ts` - Creates sample data for testing
- `src/lib/test-stock-history.ts` - Testing utilities and validation

### UI Components

- `src/app/admin/inventory/history/page.tsx` - Updated main history page

## Usage

### 1. View Stock History

Navigate to `/admin/inventory/history` to see all stock transactions.

### 2. Filter Transactions

Use the search bar and dropdown filters to find specific transactions:

- Search by product name, notes, or transaction ID
- Filter by transaction type (purchase/sale/adjustment)
- Select time range for date filtering

### 3. View Transaction Details

Click the "View" button on any transaction to see detailed information including:

- Product details
- Transaction type and amount
- Date and notes
- Price per unit

### 4. Demo Data (Development)

If no transactions exist, click the "Demo Data" button to create sample transactions for testing.

## API Endpoints

### `stockHistoryApi.getStockTransactions(filters?)`

Fetches filtered stock transactions from Sanity, excluding soft deleted items.

**Parameters:**

- `filters.type` - Transaction type filter
- `filters.dateFrom` - Start date filter
- `filters.dateTo` - End date filter
- `filters.search` - Search term
- `filters.productId` - Specific product filter

**Data Filtering:**

- Excludes transactions where `deleted` field is defined (soft deleted)
- Excludes transactions for products where `deleted` field is defined or `isActive` is not `true`
- Only returns transactions with valid, active product references

**Returns:**

```typescript
{
  success: boolean;
  data?: StockTransaction[];
  error?: string;
}
```

### `stockHistoryApi.getStockHistorySummary(filters?)`

Gets summary statistics for stock transactions.

**Returns:**

```typescript
{
  success: boolean;
  data?: {
    totalTransactions: number;
    totalPurchases: number;
    totalSales: number;
    totalPurchaseAmount: number;
    totalSalesAmount: number;
    netProfit: number;
  };
  error?: string;
}
```

## Data Structure

### StockTransaction Interface

```typescript
interface StockTransaction {
  id: string;
  itemId: string;
  itemName: string;
  type: "purchase" | "sale" | "adjustment";
  quantity: number;
  price: number;
  totalAmount: number;
  date: Date;
  notes?: string;
  createdBy: string;
}
```

### Sanity Schema

The API expects stock transactions in Sanity with this structure:

```javascript
{
  _type: "stockTransaction",
  transactionId: string,
  type: "purchase" | "sale" | "adjustment" | "return" | "damage",
  product: reference to product,
  quantity: number,
  unitPrice: number,
  totalAmount: number,
  notes?: string,
  status: string,
  transactionDate: datetime,
  createdAt: datetime
}
```

## Development Notes

### Testing

- Use the "Demo Data" button to create sample transactions
- Check browser console for API call logs
- Use `window.demoStockData` in console for manual testing

### Error Handling

- Network errors show retry buttons
- Empty states guide users to create data
- Loading states prevent multiple simultaneous requests

### Performance

- Data is fetched on component mount and filter changes
- Debounced search to prevent excessive API calls
- Efficient Sanity queries with proper indexing

## Next Steps

1. **Real Transaction Creation**: Integrate with inventory management to create real transactions
2. **Export Functionality**: Add CSV/PDF export for transaction history
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Add charts and trend analysis
4. **Bulk Operations**: Allow bulk transaction management
5. **Audit Trail**: Enhanced logging and change tracking

## Troubleshooting

### No Transactions Showing

1. Check if products exist in Sanity
2. Use "Demo Data" button to create sample data
3. Check browser console for API errors
4. Verify Sanity connection and permissions

### Slow Loading

1. Check Sanity query performance
2. Consider adding pagination for large datasets
3. Optimize filters to reduce data transfer

### Filter Not Working

1. Verify filter parameters are correctly formatted
2. Check date range calculations
3. Ensure search terms are properly escaped
