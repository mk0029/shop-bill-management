# Inventory Delete Functionality

## 🎯 Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive delete functionality implemented for inventory items, supporting both individual and consolidated item deletion with proper confirmation dialogs and safety checks.

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. **Smart Delete Detection**
- ✅ Detects if item is consolidated (multiple entries)
- ✅ Shows appropriate confirmation based on item type
- ✅ Displays consolidated entry count and details

### 2. **Safety Checks**
- ✅ Prevents deletion of items with active transactions
- ✅ Prevents deletion of items with pending bills
- ✅ Shows warnings for items with current stock
- ✅ Creates audit trail before deletion

### 3. **Confirmation Dialog**
- ✅ Rich confirmation modal with product details
- ✅ Shows stock information and warnings
- ✅ Displays consolidated item information
- ✅ Clear action buttons with loading states

### 4. **Consolidated Item Handling**
- ✅ Deletes all entries when consolidated item is deleted
- ✅ Shows count of entries being deleted
- ✅ Maintains data consistency across all related entries

## 🏗️ Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### 1. **Enhanced Inventory API** (`src/lib/inventory-api-enhanced.ts`)
```typescript
async deleteProduct(
  productId: string,
  deleteConsolidated: boolean = false,
  consolidatedIds?: string[]
): Promise<InventoryApiResponse>
```

**Features:**
- Validates no active transactions or pending bills
- Creates final stock transaction for audit trail
- Handles both individual and bulk deletion
- Returns detailed results with error handling

#### 2. **Delete Confirmation Components** (`src/components/inventory/delete-confirmation.tsx`)

**DeleteConfirmation Component:**
- Full-featured confirmation dialog
- Shows product details, stock info, and warnings
- Displays consolidated item information
- Error handling and loading states

**QuickDeleteConfirmation Component:**
- Simplified confirmation for quick actions
- Minimal UI with essential information
- Suitable for bulk operations

#### 3. **Enhanced Inventory Hook** (`src/hooks/use-enhanced-inventory.ts`)
```typescript
const { deleteProduct, isDeletingProduct, deleteError } = useEnhancedInventory();
```

**Features:**
- Handles delete operations with loading states
- Automatic data refresh after successful deletion
- Error state management
- Optimistic UI updates

### Safety Mechanisms

#### 1. **Pre-deletion Validation**
```typescript
// Check for active transactions
const activeTransactions = await sanityClient.fetch(
  `count(*[_type == "stockTransaction" && product._ref == $productId && status == "pending"])`
);

// Check for pending bills
const pendingBills = await sanityClient.fetch(
  `count(*[_type == "bill" && items[].product._ref == $productId && status in ["draft", "confirmed", "in_progress"]])`
);
```

#### 2. **Audit Trail Creation**
```typescript
// Create final stock transaction before deletion
if (product.inventory.currentStock > 0) {
  await sanityClient.create({
    _type: 'stockTransaction',
    type: 'adjustment',
    quantity: product.inventory.currentStock,
    notes: `Product deleted from inventory. Final stock: ${currentStock}`,
    // ... other fields
  });
}
```

#### 3. **Consolidated Item Handling**
```typescript
const idsToDelete = deleteConsolidated && consolidatedIds 
  ? consolidatedIds 
  : [productId];

// Process each ID for deletion
for (const id of idsToDelete) {
  // Validation and deletion logic
}
```

## 🔄 Delete Workflow

### Individual Item Deletion:
1. **User clicks delete** → Shows confirmation dialog
2. **User confirms** → Validates item safety
3. **Safety checks pass** → Creates audit trail
4. **Delete from Sanity** → Updates local state
5. **Refresh data** → Shows success feedback

### Consolidated Item Deletion:
1. **User clicks delete** → Detects consolidated status
2. **Shows consolidated warning** → Lists all entries to be deleted
3. **User confirms** → Validates all entries
4. **Safety checks pass** → Creates audit trails for all
5. **Delete all entries** → Updates local state
6. **Refresh data** → Shows success feedback

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Confirmation Dialog Features:
- **Product Information**: Name, brand, category, specifications
- **Stock Warnings**: Current stock levels and value
- **Consolidated Details**: Number of entries, latest update date
- **Safety Warnings**: Permanent deletion notice
- **Error Display**: Clear error messages if deletion fails
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during deletion process

### Visual Indicators:
- **Red color scheme** for destructive actions
- **Warning icons** for important information
- **Loading spinners** during operations
- **Success/error feedback** after completion

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Basic Delete Implementation:
```typescript
import { useEnhancedInventory } from '@/hooks/use-enhanced-inventory';
import { DeleteConfirmation } from '@/components/inventory/delete-confirmation';

function InventoryTable() {
  const { deleteProduct, isDeletingProduct, deleteError } = useEnhancedInventory();
  const [deleteItem, setDeleteItem] = useState(null);
  const [showDeleteModal, setShowDeleteModal] = useState(false);

  const handleDeleteClick = (product) => {
    setDeleteItem(product);
    setShowDeleteModal(true);
  };

  const handleDeleteConfirm = async () => {
    const success = await deleteProduct(
      deleteItem._id,
      !!deleteItem._consolidated,
      deleteItem._consolidated?.originalIds
    );
    
    if (success) {
      setShowDeleteModal(false);
      // Refresh data
    }
  };

  return (
    <>
      {/* Table with delete buttons */}
      <button onClick={() => handleDeleteClick(product)}>
        <Trash2 className="w-4 h-4" />
      </button>

      {/* Delete confirmation modal */}
      <DeleteConfirmation
        isOpen={showDeleteModal}
        onClose={() => setShowDeleteModal(false)}
        onConfirm={handleDeleteConfirm}
        product={deleteItem}
        isConsolidated={!!deleteItem?._consolidated}
        isDeleting={isDeletingProduct}
        error={deleteError}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Consolidated Item Detection:
```typescript
// Check if item is consolidated
const isConsolidated = !!product._consolidated;
const consolidatedCount = product._consolidated?.totalEntries;
const originalIds = product._consolidated?.originalIds;

// Handle deletion accordingly
await deleteProduct(productId, isConsolidated, originalIds);
```

## 🛡️ Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios:
1. **Active Transactions**: "Cannot delete product: Has active transactions"
2. **Pending Bills**: "Cannot delete product: Has pending bills"
3. **Product Not Found**: "Product not found"
4. **Network Errors**: "Failed to delete product: Network error"
5. **Permission Errors**: "Insufficient permissions to delete product"

### Error Recovery:
- Clear error messages displayed in confirmation dialog
- Retry mechanism for network failures
- Data refresh to restore consistent state
- Graceful degradation for partial failures

## 📊 Data Consistency

### Deletion Process:
1. **Validation Phase**: Check constraints and dependencies
2. **Audit Phase**: Create transaction records for history
3. **Deletion Phase**: Remove product from database
4. **Cleanup Phase**: Update related references
5. **Refresh Phase**: Update local state and UI

### Rollback Mechanism:
- Failed deletions don't affect database state
- Local state is refreshed on errors
- Audit trails are preserved even on failures
- User is informed of any issues
